# API Response Wrapper

A lightweight and efficient tool for managing API responses. This library makes it easy to standardize and handle response structures across your application.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Structures**: Ensures that all API endpoints return data with a consistent format.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily adjustable to fit the specific requirements of your API.
- **High Performance**: Minimal overhead for optimized performance.

## Installation

Clone or download the project to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtlasFreight/response_wrapper.git
```
Alternatively, you can add this library as a dependency directly in your project. Follow the instructions below based on your build tool:

- **For Maven:** Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.atlasfreight</groupId>
    <artifactId>response-wrapper</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.dev1</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

## Quick Usage

### Creating Errors

Suppose youâ€™re handling an error for a missing endpoint. You can construct an `ApiError` object as follows:

```java
import response.ApiSubError;
import java.util.List;

ApiError apiError = new ApiError.Builder()
    .setMessage("Endpoint not found: " + ex.getRequestURL())
    .setException(ex)
    .setStatus(404)
    .build();
```

### Creating Successful and Failed Responses

From an `ApiError` instance, create a failed response:

```java
Response response = Response.fail(apiError);
```

To create a successful response with generic data:

```java
Response response = Response.success(data);
```

### Example of Resulting JSON

For a success scenario:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "message": "Operation completed successfully"
  }
}
```

For an error scenario:

```json
{
  "status": "failure",
  "error": {
    "message": "Endpoint not found: /users/20",
    "code": 404,
    "subErrors": []
  }
}
```

- **Java SDK 21** and later versions.
- Frameworks such as **Spring Boot** (optional).
